description: Generate the add-in manifest XML with your cloud config baked in
---

# Generate add-in manifest

The script fetches the canonical manifest from `pivot.claude.ai/manifest.xml`
and appends your config as URL query parameters. The add-in reads them at
startup.

## Keys by cloud

Prompt only for the keys their cloud path needs. Don't ask for all eight.

| Cloud | Keys |
|---|---|
| Vertex | `gcp_project_id` `gcp_region` `google_client_id` `google_client_secret` |
| Bedrock | `aws_role_arn` `aws_region` |
| Gateway | `gateway_url` `gateway_token` |

## Entra SSO

`entra_sso=1` makes the add-in acquire an Entra ID token at startup. Set it
when your deployment needs the user's Microsoft identity — Bedrock uses it as
the STS web identity, the bootstrap endpoint uses it as Bearer auth, and
per-user attrs ([update-user-attrs](update-user-attrs.md)) ride inside it as
`extn.*` claims.

**Admin consent is a prerequisite.** Without it, every user hits a Microsoft
consent dialog on first open. Run [consent](consent.md) first so
`entra_sso=1` is silent for your users.

If you don't need Entra — static gateway config, Vertex with Google OAuth —
leave it off. Users won't see a Microsoft prompt for a setup that doesn't
involve Microsoft.

## Bootstrap endpoint

`bootstrap_url` points to an HTTPS endpoint you host. At startup the add-in
fetches per-user config from it; the response overrides manifest values for
that user.

**Request**

```
GET <bootstrap_url>
Authorization: Bearer <entra_id_token>    # present only when entra_sso=1
```

If `entra_sso=1` is set, validate the JWT: `aud` is
`c2995f31-11e7-4882-b7a7-ef9def0a0266`, `iss` is your tenant's
`https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TENANT_ID>/v2.0`, and `oid` is the user's
stable object ID for your allowlist. Without `entra_sso`, the request has no
Authorization header — for endpoints behind network isolation, mTLS, or another
auth layer the add-in doesn't see.

**Response** — `200 OK`, `application/json`

The endpoint must set `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to the add-in's origin
(`https://pivot.claude.ai` for production) — the call is browser-side fetch,
so without CORS the response is blocked before the add-in sees it.

A flat object with any subset of the config keys. All fields optional — return
only what this user needs.

```json
{
  "gateway_url": "https://llm-gateway.yourcompany.internal/v1",
  "gateway_token": "sk-user-scoped-…",
  "aws_role_arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/ClaudeBedrockAccess-TeamA"
}
```

The add-in ignores unrecognized keys, so the envelope is forward-compatible.
Today it carries provider config; future versions may read `skills`,
`mcp_servers`, or other per-user provisioning from the same response without
requiring endpoint changes on your side.

## Auto-connect

Default: when all fields for a provider are set, users skip the connection form
and land straight in chat. Ask: should they instead see the form first
(prefilled, one click)? Yes → `auto_connect=0`.

## Version

M365 Admin Center caches by `<Id>` + `<Version>` — re-upload with the same
version is silently ignored. After the script writes `manifest.xml`, ask whether
this replaces an existing deployment; if yes, edit `<Version>` to bump the
fourth segment past their last deployed value. First deploy can leave the
template's version as-is.

## Run

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/build-manifest.mjs" manifest.xml \
  gcp_project_id=<value> \
  gcp_region=<value> \
  auto_connect=0 \
  ...
```

The script validates key names (unknown keys fail hard) and shape-hints values
(warns but doesn't block — their infra may look different).

## Validate

```bash
npx --yes office-addin-manifest validate manifest.xml
```

If validation passes but M365 Admin Center still rejects or ignores the upload,
match the symptom below. Edit `manifest.xml` directly, then re-validate.

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| "An add-in with this ID already exists" | Replace the text inside `<Id>` with a fresh UUID. The template carries the marketplace install's ID. |
| Re-upload accepted but nothing changes | M365 caches by ID + version. Edit `<Version>` to a higher fourth segment (e.g. `1.0.0.9` → `1.0.0.10`) and re-validate. |
| Only want Excel (not PowerPoint) | Remove `<Host>` elements for `Presentation`. **Two parallel lists:** the top-level `<Hosts>` uses `Name="Presentation"`, the one under `<VersionOverrides>` uses `xsi:type="Presentation"` — both must go or the manifest is inconsistent. The `xsi:type` block is multi-line, delete the whole `<Host xsi:type="Presentation">...</Host>`. |
